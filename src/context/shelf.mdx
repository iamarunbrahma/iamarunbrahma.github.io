## Bookshelf

These picks track the lessons I revisit whenever life gets loud, and they show up in how I plan, collaborate, and recharge. I am sharing them so the next time someone asks how I stay energized, intentional, and climate-conscious, I can point here and say start with chapter one. If you discover a book that belongs on this shelf, tell me so we can swap takeaways.
