LLMs are reshaping every workflow, from code generation to RAG-powered enterprise search. I firmly believe Gen AI will democratize intelligence, amplify human creativity, and accelerate discovery to drive smarter decisions, equitable opportunity, and compounding prosperity worldwide.

My current interests include multimodal fine-tuning, LLM alignment, and reasoning. I have a proven track record of building AI-enabled products and driving business growth in the finance, healthcare, and retail domains.

I am a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Walmart, where I work on Gen AI initiatives, notably the Agentic AI Shopping Assistant.
