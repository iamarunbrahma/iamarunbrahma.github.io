## ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

I'm that person who gets unreasonably excited about making machines talk (and occasionally sass back). 

While everyone's jumping on the AI bandwagon (yes, another AI enthusiast!), I've been quietly building the future for *8+ years* as a Machine Learning Engineer.

Currently leading the ML Engineering brigade at Citi, where I convince large language models to behave themselves in the finance world.

Previously, I have left a trail of successful ML implementations across different industries (from healthcare to consulting).

When I'm not debugging production models, you'll find me:
- Teaching LLMs to see and think
- Fine-tuning models until they're more precise than my coffee measurements
- Making LLMs reason better than my Netflix recommendations
- Building RAG applications that actually remember what they read


#### My Tech Arsenal âš¡
*Because every AI whisperer needs their tools of trade*

- Deep Learning Sorcery: Python (my trusty wand), PyTorch, HuggingFace ðŸ¤—, CUDA
- Model Training Magic: QLoRA, DPO, LoRA, GPTQ (fancy acronyms that make my models go brrr)
- Data Science Weapons: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PySpark, XGBoost
- MLOps Fortress: Docker, Kubernetes, Git, FastAPI, MLFlow

***Spoiler Alert***: Gen AI isn't just having a moment; it's rewriting the whole book. Whether you're excited or terrified about AI taking over the world, let's connect and make sure it happens the right way! ðŸš€
